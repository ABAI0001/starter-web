ng to understand about git rebase is that it solves the same problem as git merge. Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branchâ€”they just do it in very different ways.

Consider what happens when you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, then another team member updates the master branch with new commits. This results in a forked history, which should be familiar to anyone who has used Git as a collaboration tool.
